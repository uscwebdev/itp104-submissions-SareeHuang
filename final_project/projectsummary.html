        <p>
            In this project, I made several web pages to share places that I have visited and loved. For each page I included pictures that I took and descriptions of the sites.

            For the extra, I included an iframe to display a video about Hawaii on the Hawaii page and a contact me page that allows viewers to send me messages.
