        <h1>Project Summary</h1>

        <p>
            In this project, I made several web pages to share places that I have visited and loved. For each page I included pictures that I took and descriptions of the sites.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the extra, I included an iframe to display a video about Hawaii on the Hawaii page and a contact me page that allows viewers to send me messages.
        </p>

        <p>The links to images all work on my device, but perhaps because of my macbook's icloud setting, pics are constantly offloaded to icloud and image links appear to be broken on my github srudent page. I have been downloading my images and trying to make new links, but they still are still broken on the github page :((( </p>
